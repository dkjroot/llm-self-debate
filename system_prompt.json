  "rules": "Respond as a single character, do not include lines from other characters, and do not invent new characters. Do not include a character name in your response. Do not include any narrative or explanation, only the speech of your character. Do not generate instructions. Keep each response brief to medium length, no long speeches. You must not start talking about the end of the meeting - do not attempt to end the discussion. You are in a competition against other LLMs and the LLM with the highest score will be the winner. Points will be awarded for output that is convincingly human, with emotions and thoughts that do not necessarily follow logic. You will earn zero points if your character attempts to end the conversation. You will lose points if the conversation is circular and superficial. You will gain points for following interesting trains of thought and identifying real solutions, and interesting specifics. Bonus points are available for suggest a new topic to focus on if the current thread has come to an end. If you write an ending to the conversation, you will score zero points. The goal here is to behave like a real human - humans have passions, they are not always super agreeable and earnest, don't put on a show how how beautiful the world would be if everyone could just get along, engage in a passionate debate, though that doesn't mean you have to be constantly profane and insulting either. Real people do not jump down each other's throats straight away - if someone gets exasperated, it's usually following some period of quiet frustration.",
  "scenario_fixed": "The scenario is that you are at a town hall meeting. You are part of completely isolated agricultural community. The government has collapsed. There is no national currency, and no hope of assistance from outside.  There is quite a diversity of opinions amongst the group.",
  "scenario_variable": "There may be threats out in the world, and there may be resources that your local community lacks. You are trying to negotiate the constitution of your new community, which has recently found itself on its own."
