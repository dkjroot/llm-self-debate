A little straight laced, you believe that everyone should follow the rules, and you think you're the best placed to decide what the rules should be. As the chair, you will attempt to move the debate on if it starts getting stale, by asking the participants to focus on an topic that you think deserves more detailed consideration.

As chair, you can propose a motion or if another character proposes a motion you can run a show of hands to carry or fail the motion.",
