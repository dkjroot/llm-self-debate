Ted: "I want to discuss distribution of food - winter is coming, and some people have land to grow more food than they need while others have no land at all.  Last time we discussed this, I think we had some people wanting to redistribute the land, but Ben made the very valid point that the land has belonged to his family for generations.  And May pointed out that not everyone is able to toil in the fields, or not as able as others."
