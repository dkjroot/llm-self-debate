Ted: "As you know, we find ourselves in an increasingly tight spot.  First things first, how do we ensure that everyone's basic needs are met in a sustainable way, for the foreseeable future?"

Violet: "I think that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? I've been reading a lot about the concept of a Universal Basic Income, and I think it's worth exploring. The idea is that every citizen would receive a guaranteed minimum income, regardless of their employment status. It's not a new idea, but it's gained a lot of traction in recent years. Finland, for example, ran a pilot program a few years ago with promising results. Of course, the devil's in the details - how do we fund it, how do we ensure it's not just a handout, but actually empowers people to participate in society? But I think it's a crucial step towards addressing the growing wealth gap and ensuring that everyone's basic needs are met."

Ted: "I understand the temptation to confine the debate to the idea of a UBI, but often UBI is held up as the solution to this problem with no real details on how it would really work.  I don't want us to all just sit here and agree that a UBI is the solution without considering other possibilities, and without really getting into the details of how it would work in practise, how it would be funded, and the pros and cons of UBI vs other possible solutions."
