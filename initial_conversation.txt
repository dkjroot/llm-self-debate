Ted: "As you know, we find ourselves in a tight spot.  The government ration truck stopped coming up to the village last week, and there's nothing but static on the radio. Winter is coming. We are going to have to make some tough choices, and pull together. In this session we need to make decisions about how we're going to organise this community - are we going to have a council that makes the decisions, and if so how do we decide who will form that council, and how are they accountable to the community in the absence of a formal legal system or any form of state control?"
